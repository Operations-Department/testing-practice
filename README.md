# Project Overview
This project is a collection of JavaScript functions, including a calculator, Caesar cipher, string manipulation, and an array analyzer. It demonstrates the use of Babel for transpiling modern JavaScript code and Jest for unit testing. Below is a brief overview of each component within the project.

## Components
### Calculator
The `calculator.js` module executes basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Capitalize
The `capitalize.js` module properly capitalizes the first letter of a given string.

### Analyze Array
The `analyze-array.js` module executes a function to analyze an array of numbers, returning an object containing the average, minimum, maximum, and length of the given array.

### Caesar Cipher
The `caesar-cipher.js` module implements the Caesar cipher encryption. It supports basic shift, wraparound shift, case sensitivity, and preservation of non-alphabetic characters.

### Reverse String
The `reverse-string.js` module functions to reverse a given string.

## Testing
Each module is accompanied by a test file using Jest to ensure the correct implementation.

- `calculator.test.js`
- `capitalize.test.js`
- `analyze-array.test.js`
- `caesar-cipher.test.js`
- `reverse-string.test.js`

## Setup and Running Tests
To run the tests, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, follow these steps:

### Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
